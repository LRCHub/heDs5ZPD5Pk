[00:33.31] OutsideOutsideinter's night as the rain begins to fall
[00:39.49] There's a chill in the air and a howl of the wolf
[00:43.33] While the rain beats at the door.
[00:59.83] 
[00:46.12] Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high
[00:52.27] And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry.
[01:27.77] 
[00:58.32] When the dawn of a new day will see the light
[01:01.73] And the strongest hearts grow old
[01:04.84] And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow.
[01:31.84] 
[01:24.53] Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead
[01:30.69] In the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one hears what once was said
[01:37.29] And the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold
[01:43.49] When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold.
[02:17.99] 
[01:49.56] When the color of night will fade to light
[01:52.96] And the weakest hearts grow cold
[01:56.13] And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow.
[02:23.13] 
[02:02.14] And we're standing one and all fighting 'till we fall
[02:06.04] Hoping for a better day.
[02:09.12] Never giving in until we find the words, 'till we find the words to say
[02:15.47] Untill we find the words to say
[02:30.97] 
[02:18.99] Burning starfire, shine in the sky
[02:25.80] For the lifes of great men, who stand by your side
[02:32.34] When the night falls, on we will ride
[02:38.60] For no lost souls will live on forever.
[02:58.10] 
[02:59.17] Dark night on the valley below still the horsemen follow through
[03:04.76] There's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill, that inside the magic holds
[03:11.57] Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies
[03:17.67] And the shadows of the night will no longer hide, all the mysteries come undone.
[03:57.67] 
[03:24.23] When the color of night will fade to light
[03:27.30] And the weaker hearts go cold
[03:30.33] And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow
[03:56.83] 
[03:36.50] And we're standing one and all fighting 'till we fall
[03:40.12] Hoping for a better day.
[03:43.33] Never giving in until we find the words, 'till we find the words to say
[03:49.54] 'Till we find the words to say
[04:04.54] 
[03:52.74] Burning starfire, shine in the sky
[04:00.21] For the lifes of great men, who stand by your side
[04:06.66] When the night falls, on we will ride
[04:13.08] For no lost souls will live on forever.
[04:44.46] And we're standing one and all fighting 'till we fall
[04:49.39] Hoping for a better day
[04:52.37] Never giving in until we find the words, 'till we find the words to say
[04:58.45] 'Till we find the words to say
[05:02.18] Burning starfire, shine in the sky
[05:09.05] For the lifes of great men, who stand by your side
[05:15.33] When the night falls, on we will ride
[05:21.82] For no lost souls will live on forever.
[05:29.08] No lost souls will live on forever.
